##  Mushroom Classification Project
This project was completed during my certificate course for Data Science at Brainstation Inc. The full project code is attached as a juypter notebook in the main section.

##  Project goal
Analyze the mushroom dataset to determine which factors make a mushroom more likely to be
poisonous.


## Dataset
This dataset includes 61,069 mushrooms based on 173 species (353 mushrooms per species).
Each mushroom is identified as definitely edible, or potentially poisonous. Of the 12 variables, 9
are categorical and 3 are continuous.

 ## Questions
1. Univariate descriptive summaries: Pick two categorical and two continuous variables
that are not class. Describe their distributions using summary statistics and
visualizations.
2. Missing data: Describe the patterns of missingness in the data. How often are
observations missing for each variable? Does missingness tend to co-occur among the
variables?
3. Feature-outcome relationships: For the same variables as in question 1, assess their
relationship with the outcome variable class using appropriate summary statistics and
visualizations.
4. Predictive modeling: Fit a model to predict class from other variables in the dataset.
Using a training-test split, assess the modelâ€™s performance.
